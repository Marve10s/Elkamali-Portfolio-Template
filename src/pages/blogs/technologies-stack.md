# Technologies and Libraries Iâ€™ve Worked With

Here's a quick overview of the key technologies, libraries, and tools that form the core of my front-end development toolkit:

## 1. **Astro**

Astro is a modern static site builder that emphasizes performance and developer experience. It allows me to create fast, optimized websites using frameworks like React and Svelte.

## 2. **React**

React is a powerful library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Its component-based architecture promotes modular and maintainable code.

## 3. **JavaScript & TypeScript**

JavaScript powers interactive web elements, while TypeScript adds type safety, helping catch errors early and manage large codebases effectively.

## 4. **Three.js**

Three.js is used for creating animated 3D graphics in the browser, enhancing user experience with visually stunning elements.

## 5. **GSAP**

GSAP is a robust library for high-performance animations, bringing projects to life with smooth, professional-grade animations.

## 6. **Core-js**

Core-js provides polyfills for ECMAScript features, ensuring code compatibility across different environments and browsers.

## 7. **Vite, Parcel & Webpack**

These are tools for bundling and building JavaScript applications, each offering unique advantages like fast development experiences, zero-configuration builds, and comprehensive module bundling.

## 8. **PostCSS, Sass, SCSS & Less**

These CSS preprocessors and tools extend CSS capabilities with variables, nesting, and mixins, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable stylesheets.

## 9. **Basic Knowledge of PHP and C**

In addition to front-end expertise, I have basic knowledge of PHP for server-side scripting and C for foundational programming concepts and performance-critical applications.
